Yes, there are several tools and frameworks you can use to replicate AWS Lambda functions in your local environment. Here are some popular ones:

### 1. **AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)**
- **Description**: AWS SAM is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It extends AWS CloudFormation to provide a simplified way of defining the Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by your serverless application.
- **Local Testing**: SAM CLI provides the `sam local` command that lets you run your Lambda functions locally, invoke them, and test them with events.
- **Installation**: You can install the SAM CLI using Homebrew on macOS, pip on Linux, or the MSI installer on Windows.
- **Documentation**: [AWS SAM Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html)

### 2. **LocalStack**
- **Description**: LocalStack is a fully functional local AWS cloud stack. It provides an easy-to-use test/mocking framework for developing cloud applications.
- **Local Testing**: You can run LocalStack as a Docker container and it will spin up a local environment that mimics a subset of AWS services, including Lambda.
- **Installation**: You need Docker to run LocalStack. You can pull the LocalStack image from Docker Hub and run it.
- **Documentation**: [LocalStack Documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/)

### 3. **Serverless Framework**
- **Description**: The Serverless Framework enables you to build and deploy serverless applications on AWS Lambda and other serverless computing platforms.
- **Local Testing**: The framework has a `serverless invoke local` command that allows you to invoke your Lambda function locally.
- **Installation**: You can install the Serverless Framework globally using npm.
- **Documentation**: [Serverless Framework Documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/)

### 4. **Docker Lambda**
- **Description**: Docker Lambda provides Docker images that simulate the AWS Lambda environment.
- **Local Testing**: You can use these Docker images to run your Lambda functions locally in an environment that closely mimics the actual Lambda runtime.
- **Installation**: You need Docker to use Docker Lambda. Pull the appropriate Lambda runtime image from Docker Hub.
- **Documentation**: [Docker Lambda GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda)

### 5. **LambCI**
- **Description**: LambCI is a continuous integration system built on AWS Lambda.
- **Local Testing**: It includes Docker images that you can use to simulate the Lambda environment for local testing.
- **Installation**: You need Docker to use LambCI. Pull the appropriate image from Docker Hub.
- **Documentation**: [LambCI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda)

### 6. **Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Mocking Libraries**
- **Description**: Use mocking libraries to simulate AWS services in your unit tests.
- **Local Testing**: Libraries such as `moto` (for Python) or `aws-sdk-mock` (for Node.js) allow you to mock AWS services and test your code locally.
- **Installation**: Install these libraries via pip (for Python) or npm (for Node.js).
- **Documentation**:
  - [moto Documentation](http://docs.getmoto.org/en/latest/)
  - [aws-sdk-mock Documentation](https://github.com/dwyl/aws-sdk-mock)

These tools and frameworks should help you effectively develop, test, and debug your AWS Lambda functions in your local environment.
