### How to Train the Model:
1. **Data Collection:** Use the above links to collect data and create a rich dataset. Store relevant PDFs, reports, and articles in a retrievable format.
2. **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tune your model with the collected data and train it to use RAG architecture to retrieve and synthesize information from these resources.
3. **Question-Answer Pairing:** Create a Q&A dataset using the questions listed above. Ensure that the model is trained to fetch the right sections from the PDF reports, web pages, and other documents to answer these questions accurately.
4. **Evaluation:** Test the model’s responses to these questions by comparing them against expert analysis or existing reports to ensure accuracy and relevance.

By training a model using these resources and questions, Cargill can create a powerful tool to ensure compliance, optimize market strategies, and make
